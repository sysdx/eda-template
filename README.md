# EDA Template for Tabular ML Problems

This repository contains a reusable exploratory data analysis (EDA)
template designed to quickly understand any tabular dataset.

## Why this matters
Most model performance issues come from poor data understanding,
not model choice. This template enforces a structured EDA process
before any modeling begins.

## What this shows
- Clear problem framing
- Detection of data leakage
- Understanding feature distributions
- Early signal discovery

This template is used before every supervised or unsupervised model.
